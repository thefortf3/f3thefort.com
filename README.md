# F3TheFort
Simple Child Theme for [f3thefort.com](http://f3thefort.com)

### Installation
Zip up the files in this directory and upload it to your wordpress site from the Themes page.

### What it does
General style for the site, but also handles the custom backblast fields in the New Post editor and the rendering of the BB details when displaying posts on the site.
 - Utilizes the [Meta Box](https://metabox.io/) plugin to display those fields
 - Adds custom fields to the REST API for Slackblast to post to WordPress

### Changing it
You should update the file locally and re-upload the zip to the site.  Attempting to update the theme right from the admin pages will result in those changes being lost if someone updates the theme from the zip file.
